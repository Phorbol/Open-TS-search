ABSTRACT: Efficient transition state location is a central
challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. While single-ended methods
are more efficient than double-ended methods, their convergence is
often highly sensitive to the quality of the initial guess. Here, we
propose a Cone-shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton (CCQN)
method, which introduces a cone-shaped constraint to restrict the
search direction, thereby effectively guiding the system from
potential well regions toward saddle regions. After crossing the
inflection curve, the optimization switches to the partitioned
rational function optimization algorithm for further refinement.
This curvature partitioned optimization strategy reduces the sensitivity to the quality of the initial guess while maintaining the
efficiency of single-ended methods. Across 150 transition state optimization tasks with varying initial guess qualities, CCQN achieves
an overall success rate of 93.3%, requiring only approximately 50 energy-force evaluations on average. The method exhibits strong
robustness and convergence efficiency, offering a new tool for high-throughput transition state searches and mechanistic studies of
complex catalytic reactions.
1. INTRODUCTION
The elementary reaction energy barriers, as central parameters
in catalytic microkinetic analysis, serve as critical metrics for
evaluating the intrinsic activity of catalysts.
1−12
On the
potential energy surface (PES), the transition state (TS)
corresponds to an energy maximum point along the minimum
energy path (MEP) connecting two local minima. According
to TS theory based on the harmonic approximation, this
critical point is rigorously defined as a first-order saddle point
(FOSP) on the PES, where the local Hessian matrix possesses
exactly one negative eigenvalue. Compared to relaxation
process, FOSP optimization significantly increases computa-
tional complexity due to the requirement of curvature analysis
on high-dimensional PES. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in heterogeneous catalysis, where systems often
contain dozens to hundreds of atoms, making TS searches a
computational bottleneck in catalyst rational design. Common
optimization strategies can be broadly classified into three
categories: double-ended interpolation methods, single-ended
gradient-based methods, and hybrid methods.
Typical double-ended path interpolation methods include
the nudged elastic band (NEB) method
13,14
and the growing
string method (GSM).
15
Their core principle involves defining
the reactant and product configurations as end points of the
MEP on the PES, approximating the reaction path by inserting
discrete sampling points. During optimization, elastic mechan-
ical constraints are imposed between sampling points, and the
configurations are iteratively optimized using the Broyden-
Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm until conver-
gence, with the final energy maximum identified as an
approximate FOSP solution. However, this method requires
dense path sampling near the FOSP to ensure accuracy,
leading to significantly increased computational costs.
Single-ended gradient-based methods primarily include the
eigenvector-following (EF) method and the minimum-mode-
following (MMF) method. The EF method was originally
introduced by Cerjan and Miller
16
and later extended by
Banerjee et al. into the partitioned rational function
optimization (PRFO) algorithm.
17,18
This method requires
the local Hessian matrix to strictly possess a single negative
eigenvalue. The eigenvector corresponding to the smallest
eigenvalue (i.e., the leftmost eigenvector) defines the direction
of the reaction coordinates. Energy is maximized along this
direction while minimized in orthogonal directions, enabling
convergence to a FOSP. However, the EF method is highly
sensitive to initial conditions, the initial guess must be
sufficiently close to the saddle region to ensure the Hessian
matrix contains at least one negative eigenvalue, or the
optimization may fail. In contrast, MMF methods such as the
dimer method

and activation-relaxation technique

iteratively extract the lowest curvature mode via finite
difference approximations to determine the reaction coor-
dinates. Although computationally more demanding, these
methods are generally more robust.
22
However, when far from
the FOSP, the lowest curvature mode may deviate from the
true reaction coordinates, necessitating dynamic selection and
tracking of different eigenvectors to avoid convergence to
nontarget FOSPs.
Hybrid methods enhance robustness and efficiency by
synergizing double-ended and single-ended methods: First, a
double-ended method (e.g., NEB) is employed to generate an
initial guess configuration for the FOSP. The Hessian matrix is
initialized using the reaction path tangent. Finally, EF or MMF
methods are applied for precise FOSP refinement, achieving a
new balance between efficiency and precision. For example,
Asgeirsson et al.
23
proposed the energy-weighted climbing
image NEB (EW-CI-NEB) method to generate an initial guess
configuration, followed by secondary optimization with the EF
method. This methods achieved a 100% convergence rate with
an average of only 305 energy-force evaluations, significantly
outperforming standalone methods.
In heterogeneous catalysis, density functional theory (DFT)
based TS searching remains the primary approach for
calculating reaction energy barriers. However, a single
energy-force evaluation at the DFT level for large atomic
systems incurs extremely high computational costs. While
hybrid methods are considered the current optimal strategy,
their reliance on the double-ended method still presents a
significant challenges in high-throughput TS searches. The EF
method offers lower algorithmic complexity, as it simply
modifies the step vector calculation within the quasi-Newton
framework. Each iteration requires only one energy-force
evaluation, making it significantly less computationally
expensive than double-ended or MMF methods. However, as
a classic algorithm for FOSP optimization in EF method,
PRFO’s robustness defects stem from two main aspects:
(1) Potential well trapping: When the system configuration
lies in a potential well, the local potential energy surface
is convex, with a positive semidefinite Hessian matrix
that causes the leftmost eigenvector to point toward a
local minimum. Since PRFO lacks an escape strategy,
the system tends to converge to this local minimum.
(2) Inaccurate Hessian approximation: The low accuracy
of the approximate Hessian matrix constructed by the
quasi-Newton method causes the step vector to deviate
from the real reaction path. This deviation may lead the
system to cross the inflection curve, demarcating a
boundary between positive semidefinite and indefinite
Hessian domains, and reenter the potential well.
PRFO’s dependence on the indefinite Hessian matrix and
the limitations of the quasi-Newton method in recognizing and
maintaining negative curvature make it difficult to adapt to
complex curvature variations on PES. Consequently, develop-
ing strategies to simultaneously enhance initial guess robust-
ness and computational efficiency within the quasi-Newton
method framework remains a critical area for further
investigation.
To address the issue of limited accuracy in the approximate
Hessian matrix, Hermes, E. D. et al.
24
employed the Jacobi−
Davidson algorithm to iteratively diagonalize the leftmost
eigenvector, thereby refining the Hessian matrix and
suppressing error accumulation. Although this method can
mitigate issues caused by the low Hessian accuracy, it cannot
fundamentally resolve potential well trapping. When the
system is already trapped in a potential well, refining the
Hessian matrix has limited effectiveness. It should be noted
that this is not to deny the validity of Hessian refinement
strategies, but to emphasize that resolving potential well
trapping can mitigate problems arising from inaccurate Hessian
approximations. If the system can be pushed up into the saddle
region, the PRFO method remains applicable, avoiding the
extra computational cost of Hessian refinement.
To address the problem of easily falling into local minima,
two main strategies are commonly used. The first is the
random perturbation approach, which continuously applies
random disturbances to push the system across the inflection

curve,
25
where a reaction coordinate direction is randomly set,
and the step vector is periodically adjusted along this direction
during the search until the system successfully escapes.
19,26
While these methods can help the system escape potential
wells, their inherent randomness often causes the FOSP
optimization to converge on unintended reaction paths,
thereby significantly limiting their practical applicability in
heterogeneous catalysis.
The work by Birkholz et al.
27
demonstrated that geometric
variations along reaction pathways are predominantly governed
by a limited set of structural parameters, including bond
lengths, bond angles, and torsion angles. Building on this
insight, when the reactive bonds involved in an elementary
reaction are identified, modulating their lengths can effectively
steer the system along the desired reaction pathway, enabling
more realistic simulation of the reaction process. Bond-length-
driven strategies, such as the bond-boost method
28,29
and the
artificial force induced reaction (AFIR) method,
30,31
accelerate
sampling or search efficiency by applying bond-length-based
artificial potentials to these key reactive bonds. However, the
empirical parametrization required for these artificial potentials
reduces their transferability across different heterogeneous
catalytic systems, thereby limiting the applicability of such
strategies in heterogeneous catalysis.
To enable a directionally guided TS optimization, this work
introduces a Cone-shaped Constrained Quasi-Newton method
(CCQN). The core innovation lies in a directional escape
strategy: an approximate vector e, representing the reaction
coordinate, is first estimated, and a spherical cone is then
constructed with e as its axis and a half-apex angle ϕ. The
optimal escape path is identified by locating the minimum of
the PES within the spherical cap region. The definition of the
axis vector e is flexible. If the reactant and product
configurations are unknown but the mechanism is understood,
e can be formed from stretch/compress directions of key
reactive bonds. For example, in the dissociation of a water
molecule, the reaction coordinate is the stretching of the O−H
bond (the green arrow in Figure 1). The effective escape
direction from the initial state (diamond) to the transition
state (pentagram) typically forms an acute angle with this
bond-stretching direction. This internal coordinate (IC)-based
approach has been shown to approximate the true reaction
path with chemical accuracy, offering a chemically intuitive
basis for estimating the reaction coordinate.
27
When both the
initial and final state configurations are known, the axis vector e
can be obtained by interpolating between them. The
introduction of the cone-shaped constraint enables the system
to escape potential well region without relying on any
empirical parameters.
This design philosophy of enhancing robustness through
directional guidance bears certain similarities to the Synchro-
nous Transit and Quasi-Newton (STQN) method,
32
but the
two differ fundamentally in their core mechanisms. STQN
restricts each optimization step to a one-dimensional path,
while CCQN uses a flexible high-dimensional constraint (a
spherical cap space), allowing the optimizer to bypass energy
barriers and explore freely without being forced to follow a
geometric path that may not be optimal. Moreover, STQN is
inherently a double-ended method that requires both initial
and final states, whereas the IC-based approach in CCQN
enables genuine single-ended applicability, broadening its
range of application.
In tests, the CCQN method showed good performance,
achieving a overall success rate of 93.3% and reducing the
computational cost by 3 to 17 times compared to the Sella and
Dimer methods. Furthermore, the introduction of the cone-
shaped constraint overcomes problems in current single-ended
gradient methods, including sensitivity to initial guesses and
inaccurate search directions. For initial configurations outside
the saddle region, the FOSP optimization failure rate of
CCQN is only 6.7%, showing strong robustness.
2. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF CCQN
2.1. Quasi-Newton Method for Unconstrained Opti-
mization. Since this algorithm is a variant of the quasi-
Newton method, it is necessary to briefly review the
unconstrained quasi-Newton method.
33
Let us define the
PES of a multiatom system as a function
|
×
 f x x( )
n3 1 ,
where x denotes the Cartesian coordinates of all atoms and n is
the number of atoms. We now introduce the following
notations. For simplicity, the variable x will be omitted in g and
H in the subsequent discussion:
=

g x x
H x x
( ) ( )
 ( ) ( )
2
The coordinates at step k + 1 are given by eq 1:
= · +x x H g k k k k 1
1
(1)
However, computing the full Hessian matrix is very
expensive. The core idea of the quasi-Newton method is to
construct the following recursive formula to avoid evaluating
the full Hessian:
= + +B B B k k k1
(2)
By defining B ≈ H, eq 1 can be rewritten as
= · +x x B g k k k k 1
1
To ensure that B generated by eq 2 can replace H, the
following quasi-Newton condition must be satisfied:
= + + +g g B x x( ) k k k k k 1 1 1
(3)
Let x
k+1
- x
k
= s
k
and g
k+1
- g
k
= y
k
. Then, eq 3 can be
rewritten as
= +y B s k k k1
2.2. Approximate Hessian Matrix Updates. The basic
framework of the unconstrained quasi-Newton method is
outlined in Section 2.1. It is clear that the performance of the
quasi-Newton method strongly depends on the quality of the
matrix update B
k
in eq 2. However, the construction of the
ΔB
k
is not unique. For optimization tasks, ensuring that the
search direction points toward the minimum of the objective
function requires B
k
to remain positive definite throughout the
updates. For FOSP optimization, the complexity arises from
requiring B
k
to retain exactly one negative eigenvalue during
updates. Common approximation algorithms for B
k
, such as
Davidon−Fletcher−Powell (DFP) and BFGS, perform well in
optimization problems, but their updates enforce positive
definiteness, making them unsuitable for FOSP optimization.
To address this, Bofill and coworkers proposed the TS-BFGS
algorithm
34,35
which modifies BFGS by using the formula

Since M

2.3. Geometry Refinement. This subsection introduces a
method with a cone-shaped constraint for step vector
calculation, which enables the system to climb uphill within
potential wells. After crossing the inflection curve, the PRFO
method is used to accurately locate the FOSP in the saddle
region. The following discussion covers the uphill push in
potential well regions and the FOSP optimization in saddle
point. To simplify the mathematical formulation, the frame-
work is presented in this section under nonperiodic boundary
conditions. Nevertheless, since the principle of CCQN is
independent of spatial boundaries, all derivations remain valid
and general under periodic boundary conditions.
2.3.1. Uphill Push in Potential Well Regions. The second-
order Taylor expansion of the objective function f(x
k
+ s
k
) is
given in eq 7:
+ = + +f fx s x

While quasi-Newton method are occasionally interpreted as
minimization (or maximization) techniques, they are funda-
mentally root-finding algorithms. Taking the derivative of eq 7
with respect to s
k
and setting it to zero gives an expression for
refining stationary points:
=s B g k k k
1
(8)
In the unconstrained case, if B
k
is positive definite, the step
vector s
k
typically points toward a local minimum. Conversely,
when B
k
has exactly one negative eigenvalue, s
k
directs toward
the FOSP. This explains why the EF method struggles to
escape potential wells once trapped. To enforce x
k
to cross the
inflection curve, constraints must be introduced into eq 7 to
control the uphill direction. As previously discussed, the axis
vector e
k
can be defined by estimating the reaction coordinates.
A direct approach is to set x
k+1
= x
k
+ e
k
, followed by several
relaxations in directions perpendicular to e
k
, to ensure that the
directions orthogonal to e
k
correspond to a local minimum on
the PES. This is similar to the activation-relaxation
technique.
20,21
However, a more efficient strategy is to directly
solve the following optimization problem eq 9a:

The constraint in eq 9b restricts s
k
to lie on the boundary of
a trust-region centered at x
k
with radius Δ
k
, which ensures that
the second-order Taylor approximation remains valid locally
and helps prevent divergence from overstepping. Eq 9c, on the
other hand, strictly confines s
k
within a spherical cone defined
by the unit vector e
k
as the axis and a half-apex angle ϕ
k
. As
long as ϕ
k
< π/2, the projection of s
k
onto e
k
remains positive,
guiding x
k
into the saddle region. Noted that the constraint in
eq 9b differs from the standard trust-region condition ∥ s
k
∥ ≤
Δ
k
.
37
During the uphill phase, allowing ∥ s
k
∥ to be smaller
than Δ
k
may cause s
k
to degenerate into a zero vector, which
eliminates the climbing effect. The reason for choosing eq 9a
as the optimization objective is to enhance the stability of the
optimization process. The uphill direction provided by the
cone-shaped constraint vector e
k
is usually coarse, and applying
it directly to x
k
without adjustment may result in an
unreasonable climbing path. In contrast, eq 9a enables dynamic
adjustment of s
k
, allowing x
k
to follow a lower-energy path
under constraints and improving algorithmic stability.
Eq 9c constitutes a standard second-order cone constraint,
thus preserving the problem’s convex structure. However, the
equality constraint defined by eq 9b leads to a nonconvex
feasible set, which causes the overall optimization problem to
lose its convexity. Although the problem exhibits nonconvexity
and nonlinear constraints, analytical gradients can be derived
for both the objective function eq 9a and all constraints eq 9a
to eq 9c. This provides a solid foundation for applying the
augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).
38
Nevertheless, due to
the nonconvex feasible domain, the ALM cannot guarantee
convergence to global optima and typically yields local optimal
solutions. Notably, a local optimum suffices for practical uphill
process.
The adjustment of parameters e
k
, Δ
k
, and ϕ
k
in the
optimization problem eq 9a will be discussed in Section 2.3.3.
For the purpose of the following discussion, which focuses
solely on the k-th step of the quasi-Newton method, these
parameters are regarded as constants within the ALM
algorithm. To simplify the notation, the subscript k is omitted.
The augmented Lagrangian function is formulated as follows:

2.3.2. Optimization in Saddle Regions. After x
k
successfully
escapes from a locally convex region, using eq 8 to locate the
TS often results in a step size that is too large, exceeding the
valid range of the second-order expansion. Improper scaling of
s
k
, however, may increase iteration counts or cause
divergence.
17,18
The restricted step PRFO method has been
widely validated as efficient and robust. It builds on the
rational function optimization (RFO) framework by replacing

Therefore, RFO converts an optimization problem into an
eigenvalue problem. For minimization tasks, the solution can
be derived from the leftmost eigenvector of B. For FOSP
optimization, one may choose the second smallest eigenvalue
and its corresponding eigenvector to define the step vector s,
but in practice, this strategy often fails to reliably locate the
FOSP.
17
Considering the nature of saddle points, a μ-order
saddle point is a maximum along the directions of the first μ
smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, and a minimum
along the directions of the remaining 3n - μ larger eigenvalues.
Therefore, eq 12 can be separated into two parts: maximizing ϵ
along the chosen μ eigenvectors, and minimizing ϵ along the
remaining 3n - μ eigenvectors. First, diagonalize B:

Since ϵ

> 0 and ϵ

< 0, and their signs are consistent
with those of λ
i
, the function r(a) is strictly monotonically
increasing over the domain (0, + ∞), with a range of (0,

B
−2
g). Therefore, when the saddle point lies outside the
trust-region, we can use a bisection method to find a unique
value of a such that ∥ s ∥ = Δ, allowing the algorithm to take
the largest possible step and rapidly converge near the FOSP.
When the saddle point is within the trust-region, PRFO
reduces to eq 8 and can still reliably converge to the FOSP.
2.3.3. Update Strategy for Parameters. This work employs
two distinct strategies to determine the axis vector e: an IC-
based approach and an interpolation-based approach. When
the reactant and product configurations are unknown but the
reaction mechanism is understood, the IC-based approach is
applied. In this case, e is defined as a linear combination of the
stretching/compression directions of the reactive bonds. As
shown in Figure 2, when the bond length l ∈ (a,b), the atoms
are in an attractive state, and e points in the stretching
direction. When l ∈ (b,c), the atoms are in a repulsive state,
and e points in the compression direction. The pseudocode for
computing e is given in Algorithm 2, where the superscript (i)
denotes the i-th column of a matrix.
When both the initial and final state configurations are
known, an interpolation-based approach can be used to
estimate the reaction coordinate, making the acquisition of
the vector e a completely black box process that requires no
input. A reaction path between the current and product
configurations can be generated using nonlinear interpolation
techniques such as the image-dependent pair potential
(IDPP).
39
The midpoint of this path (x
mid
) serves as the
initial guess for the saddle point. The vector from the current
position x to x
mid
provides an effective estimate of the reaction
coordinate, and the axis vector e is defined by eq 18:
=
e
x x
 x x
mid
 mid
(18)
In the potential well, the parameters Δ and cosϕ are fixed.
The selection of cosϕ is related to to the definition of the axis
vector e. In the IC-based approach, a small cosϕ is typically
chosen to limit excessive bond-length changes and maintain
stability during uphill push. In contrast, the interpolation-based
approach requires a larger cos ϕ to enforce a strong directional
constraint, guiding the optimization toward the target region.
The choice of Δ depends on PES topography: narrower, flatter
saddle regions require smaller Δ values to ensure robustness,
while broader, more curved saddle regions benefit from larger
Δ values to improve efficiency. All Δ and cosϕ values used in
this study are listed in the Supporting Information.
When the system enters the saddle region, an automated
strategy is used to determine Δ. After each step, the ratio
between the predicted and actual energy change is evaluated:

achieves a balance between convergence efficiency and

2.4. Summary of CCQN Method. The workflow of the
CCQN algorithm is shown in Figure 3. The algorithm starts by
initializing the system coordinates x
0
, the gradient g
0
, and the
approximate Hessian matrix B
0
(typically a scaled identity
matrix). At each iteration, the method for computing the step
vector s
k
is divided into two modes based on the properties of
the current Hessian matrix B
k
: (i) if B
k
is positive definite, the
system is in a potential well, and the cone-shaped constraint
method is applied to perform the uphill push; (ii) if B
k
is
indefinite, indicating the system has crossed the inflection
curve into the saddle region, switch to the PRFO method.
Finally, check if the convergence criteria are met. Terminate
the calculation if satisfied; otherwise, proceed to the next
iteration.

interatomic force directions and bond stretching/compression
directions. The blue curve represents the simplified potential energy
profile as a function of bond length, with three dashed lines
corresponding to different equilibrium bond length values. Within the
metastable region a < r < c, the direction of bond length change is
always opposite to the interatomic force, which drives the bond length
toward the value b.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Heterogeneous Catalysis Test Set. Fischer−
Tropsch synthesis (FTS),
40−42
as a key technology for directly
converting syngas (CO/H
2
) into light olefins, holds significant
research value in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The FTS
reaction network involves typical elementary steps such as C−
C coupling, C−O bond cleavage, and dehydrogenation/
hydrogenation, covering nearly all key reaction pathways in
C1/C2 small-molecule catalytic transformations.
5
To system-
atically evaluate the performance of different single-ended
gradient methods, a benchmark test set of 30 elementary FTS
reactions (see Table 1) was constructed on a Cu(111) surface.
For each reaction, five initial guess configurations are
sampled via linear interpolation (Figure 4a), with the
construction formula x
guess
= x
saddle
+ α · v, where x
saddle
denotes the real TS configuration, v represents the displace-
ment vector pointing from the FOSP to a local minimum, and
α ∈ {0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3}. The coefficient α controls the
deviation of the initial guess configuration from the TS. This
strategy generates 150 optimization tasks (30 reactions × 5
initial guesses), providing a standardized test set for evaluating
the reliability and convergence efficiency of single-ended
methods.
3.2. Benchmarks and Performance. To systematically
evaluate the performance of the CCQN method in TS
searches, two representative single-ended optimization algo-
rithms were selected as baselines: Sella,
24,43,44
which is based
on the PRFO approach, and the Dimer method,
19
which
represents the MMF method. All optimization algorithms used

computational settings. CCQN uses an IC-based approach to

define the axis vector e. Detailed computational settings are
provided in the Supporting Information. The evaluation
framework includes four key metrics: FOSP search success
rate, false positive rate, convergence efficiency, and potential
well escape robustness, to comprehensively assess the practical
performance of different methods on the standard test set.
First, we performed a systematic analysis of the success rate
for TS searches. Under a maximum limit of 1000 energy-force
evaluations, an optimization is counted as successful only if the
following criteria are all satisfied: (1) the maximum atomic
force satisfies |F
max
| < 0.05 eV/Å; (2) Only one imaginary
frequency with wavenumber exceeding 200 cm
−1
exists; and
(3) Run intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations to ensure
that the transition state lies on the target reaction path. As
shown in Figure 4b, the CCQN method achieves high success
rates across varying initial guess qualities. At α = 0.1, the
success rate reaches 96.67%, and it remains stable at 93.33%
even under poor initial guess conditions (0.15 ≤ α ≤ 0.3). In
contrast, both the Sella and Dimer methods show strong
dependence on initial guess quality, with success rates
decreasing as α increases. This trend is consistent with the
underlying mathematical principles of these methods: when far
from the saddle point region, the leftmost eigenvector may not
reliably align with the correct reaction coordinate, increasing
the risk of optimization failure. Further analysis of false
positives (Figure 4b) classifies systems optimized to a FOSP as
positive. Among these, those on the target reaction path are
true positives (TP), while deviations from the target reaction
path are false positives (FP). Systems that fail to converge to a
FOSP are considered true negatives (TN). The statistics show
that both Sella and Dimer yield false positives in certain cases,
revealing that traditional single-ended methods may converge
to nontarget FOSPs when blindly following the leftmost
eigenvector, especially with low-quality initial guesses. In
contrast, CCQN achieves a 0% false positive rate across all
tests, with no FOSPs deviating from the target reaction path,
clearly demonstrating the strength of the cone-shaped
constraint strategy in guiding optimization direction and
ensuring convergence reliability.
In terms of convergence efficiency, this study uses the
average number of energy-force evaluations as the comparison
metric. As shown in Figure 4d, the computational cost of all
methods increases as the initial guess quality deteriorates.
However, CCQN shows the smallest increase and maintains
the lowest average number of energy-force evaluations across
all α values. In particular, under the most challenging condition
of α = 0.30, the average number of evaluations required by
CCQN is only 18.3% of that of Sella and 7.3% of that of
Dimer, demonstrating very high convergence efficiency. The
difference originates from the computational cost per iteration:
both Sella and CCQN are EF methods that require only one
energy-force evaluation per step, whereas the dimer method
involves multiple finite-difference calculations to update the
dimer orientation, significantly increasing the overall cost. This
trend is consistent with previous reports.
22
Additionally, Sella
has a higher computational cost than CCQN because it
periodically refines the approximate Hessian matrix using finite
differences. In contrast, CCQN uses a cone-shaped constraint
to restrict the search direction, allowing it to tolerate larger
errors in the approximate Hessian matrix during the early
stages of optimization, thereby maintaining the superlinear
convergence rate of quasi-Newton method.
To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the cone-
shaped constraint strategy in enabling potential well escape,

this study introduces two metrics: sensitivity and robustness
score. Due to the difficulty in directly tracking each trapping
event, the initial configurations are classified based on whether
they have an imaginary frequency with wavenumber above 200
cm
−1
. Configurations with such frequencies are labeled as
“saddle initial guess”, while the rest are considered “potential
well initial guess”. Successful convergence to the target FOSP
is used as the criterion for a successful escape. Sensitivity is
defined as the normalized difference in success rates (SR)
between the two types of initial guesses:
=
|
|
 { }
Sensitivi
ty
SR SR
 max SR , SR
saddle wel
l
 saddle wel l
(20)
A lower sensitivity indicates that the algorithm is less
dependent on the quality of the initial guess and has a stronger
ability to escape potential well. The robustness score takes into
account both the average overall success rate and the
sensitivity, and is defined as
= ×Robustnes s Score SR (1 Sensiti vity) avg
(21)
As shown in Table 2, CCQN achieved high success rates of
100.00% and 83.33% under saddle and potential well initial
guesses, respectively. With a sensitivity of only 0.1667,
resulting in a robustness score as high as 0.7833. In contrast,
the success rates of the Sella and Dimer methods declined
significantly when the quality of the initial guess decreased,
with sensitivity values reaching 0.7193 and 0.5214, respec-
tively, and corresponding robustness scores of only 0.1235 and
0.1053. These results clearly validate the effectiveness of the
cone-shaped constraint strategy in enhancing potential well
escape capability and reducing dependence on initial guesses.
To assess the performance of the CCQN method in more
practical conditions, we conducted supplementary tests. Five
reactions (R1-R5) were selected, with random noise
introduced into their initial configurations to simulate more
challenging optimization tasks. The results (detailed in the
Section S2.1) demonstrate that CCQN maintained consis-
tently good performance under these conditions. It achieved a
convergence success rate of 96%, significantly outperforming
Sella (44%) and Dimer (24%). In terms of computational
efficiency, the average number of energy-force evaluations
required by CCQN was comparable to Sella’s and 12% of that
required by Dimer. Furthermore, a comparison with the NEB
method on the same set of reactions (see Section S2.1) shows
that NEB required an average of 2,550 energy-force evaluations
to meet the same convergence criteria, whereas the computa-
tional cost of CCQN was only about one-fiftieth of that of
NEB.
In summary, CCQN outperforms the baseline methods
across four key performance metrics: FOSP search success rate,
false positive rate, convergence efficiency, and potential well
escape robustness. Particularly in the tests with noisy initial
configurations, CCQN maintained its performance, indicating
its reliability for practical applications. Compared to the widely
used NEB method, CCQN improves the convergence
efficiency by a factor of approximately 50 without compromis-
ing accuracy. These improvements are attributed to the cone-
shaped constraint strategy, which enhances the robustness and
efficiency of the TS search process by providing effective
directional guidance. The raw data supporting the figures
presented in this subsection are available in Tables S2−S4.
Detailed convergence results and frequency analyses for all
optimization tasks are provided in Tables S8−S13.
3.3. Some Additional Examples. This section aims to
comprehensively demonstrate the applicability and perform-
ance of the CCQN method in diverse chemical contexts. The
content covers conformational transitions, the main-group
molecular reactions benchmark tests, and TS search in
complex interface systems.
3.3.1. Conformational Transitions. We first evaluated
CCQN’s performance in locating conformational transition
states. For such systems, where defining specific reactive bonds
is difficult, the axis vector e was determined uniformly using
the interpolation-based approach. As shown in Figure 5a−c,
three representative cases were examined. (1) For the internal
rotation of CH
3
CH
3
around the C−C σ-bond, the transition
state corresponds to the eclipsed conformation. CCQN
successfully located this configurations after 108 energy-force
evaluations, using two adjacent staggered conformations as the
initial and final states. (2) For the umbrella inversion of NH
3
,
using “down” and “up” stable conformations as the initial and
final states, CCQN converged to the planar transition state in
24 evaluations. (3) In surface science, migration barriers are
important for understanding adsorbate diffusion. We used the
migration of an O atom between two adjacent hollow sites on a
Cu(111) surface as a case study. CCQN located the transition
state after 69 evaluations, demonstrating its applicability to
surface diffusion studies.
3.3.2. Main-Group Molecular Reactions. To evaluate
CCQN’s performance on molecular systems, we used the
main-group molecular reactions benchmark set.
23
This data set
contains 121 reactions and provides reference results for the
hybrid NEB-TS method (EW-CI-NEB combined with EF
optimization). Since the data set includes initial and final state
configurations, the axis vector e was defined using the
interpolation-based approach. On this test set, CCQN
achieved a convergence rate of 91.8%, with 91.1% of the
converged configurations being FOSPs, requiring an average of
only 152.8 energy-force evaluations. Compared with the hybrid
NEB-TS method (100% convergence, 92% FOSPs), CCQN
maintained a similar convergence rate while reducing the
computational cost by about 50% (NEB-TS averaged 305
evaluations). This suggests that CCQN offers a balanced trade-
off between convergence efficiency and accuracy. Notably, we
observed that when dealing with nonelementary reactions,

CCQN may not converge to the highest-energy saddle point
along the full reaction path. This arises because CCQN
switches to a local saddle point search via PRFO upon entering
any saddle region, without considering the global maximum
barrier. In principle, this could be addressed by scanning the
entire path along the cone-shaped constrained direction and
recording all saddle regions for subsequent searches. However,
this falls within the scope of reaction path scanning and is not
discussed further in this work. Figure 5d−f show results for
three example reactions (id 29, 100, and 102), with complete
statistics and discussion in Section S2.2.
3.3.3. Complex Interface Systems. To probe the perform-
ance of CCQN in more challenging catalytic systems, we
applied it to an Ag−Au alloy cluster, an Al-doped SiO
2
zeolite,
and a TiO
2
surface that included an explicit water model (see
Figure 5g−i). For these systems with complex potential energy
surfaces, CCQN converged in 99, 185, and 75 energy-force
evaluations, respectively. In these tests, the reactive bond were
well-defined, allowing the axis vector e to be defined using the
IC-based approach, with optimizations starting from manually
prepared initial configurations.
Collectively, these results indicate that CCQN is applicable
to TS searches across a range of complex chemical systems.
Detailed computational settings for the above test cases are
provided in the Supporting Information.
4. CONCLUSION
This study proposes the cone-shaped constrained quasi-
Newton method, which introduces a curvature partitioned
optimization strategy. It inherits the computational efficiency
and convergence accuracy of the EF method while significantly
reducing dependence on high-quality initial guesses.
Test results show that CCQN achieved an overall success
rate of 93.3% on a standard benchmark set, and still
maintained a high success rate of 83.3% under poor initial
guesses. In addition, the average number of energy-force
evaluations required by CCQN is only 21.6% of that required
by Sella and 6.6% of that required by Dimer, demonstrating
excellent computational efficiency. In false positive analysis,
CCQN exhibited a low false positive rate for FOSP
identification, indicating that the cone-shaped constraint can
effectively guide the reaction path even when the config-
urations of reactants and products are unknown. This helps
overcome the directional search limitations of single-ended
methods compared to double-ended methods. To further
quantify its ability to escape potential wells, this work uses eqs
20 and 21 to compare the robustness of CCQN against
baseline methods. The results show that CCQN has a stronger
ability to escape potential wells than baseline methods,
confirming that the cone-shaped constraint is a reliable
strategy for single-ended TS searches. Moreover, case studies
on systems such as metal clusters, doped zeolites, and metal
oxide surfaces further demonstrate the applicability and
convergence performance of CCQN across diverse material
types. In supplementary tests with noisy initial configurations,
the success rate of CCQN remained at 96%. Furthermore,
compared to the widely used NEB method, CCQN also
demonstrated high efficiency.
Another advantage of this method is its flexibility. By
incorporating the interpolation-based approach, CCQN can,
much like a double-ended method, use initial and final state
information to define the constraint direction with almost no
additional computational cost. This flexibility extends its
applicability beyond traditional single-ended methods, showing
robust performance across diverse chemical systems.
Although CCQN performs well in most cases, Sella and
Dimer converge with fewer energy-force evaluations when the
initial guess is of high quality. This is because CCQN initializes
the approximate Hessian with a scaled identity matrix,
requiring iterative refinement of the leftmost eigenvector,
whereas Sella and Dimer construct it directly via finite
differences, enabling faster and more stable convergence.
Thus, when high-quality initial guesses are available, Sella or
Dimer may be more efficient.
Overall, this study shows that CCQN is a robust and
efficient single-ended TS optimization method. It offers a new
solution for high-throughput transition state screening in
heterogeneous catalysis and other fields, and may help
accelerate the rational design and discovery of new materials
and catalysts.
